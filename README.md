# Project 3 - Shirk: A Forgiving Task Manager
===

# Deployed Site
The final version of the project has been deployed on [OpenShift](http://shirk-aandre.rhcloud.com/).

For convenience, we have made a test account -- username `ta` and password `gradeus` -- with a few pre-populated tasks. Of course, a new account can be created from the login page.


# Automated Tests
To run the tests, visit [shirk-aandre.rhcloud.com/tests.html](http://shirk-aandre.rhcloud.com/tests.html).

NOTE: The tests are not safe to be run concurrently! Only one TA should visit this URL at a time. The tests might take a little while to run (~10 seconds). After the tests have completed running, you browser will still be logged into the `test1` account.
